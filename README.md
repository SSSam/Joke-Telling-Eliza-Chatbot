# Joke-Telling-Eliza-Chatbot

This is a Joke telling Eliza chatbot.

When users input greeting words, it will return the greeting and ask the user a similar question as greeting.
And note that it is important to greet before continuing the conversation!
When this Eliza style chatbot find the user input open-ended, or not sure what to say, 
its default is to ask the user to input JOKE and then it will tell a joke to the user.
Many keywords are being set up to reply the user such as yes, no, what where how and much other INTERESTING input.
If the user finds the joke funny and interesting, the chatbot will react and laugh with the user as well.
Also, if the user asks about the chatbot's name, it will reply its name, and ask for the user's name.

This chatbot can remember user's name and use it in the later chat. 
It will ask back the question that the user is asking and it can continue the conversation quite normally, 
this allows the chatbot to chat like a real person without directly answer the question.
There are many jokes in this chatbot's data, the knowledge base, that I personally really enjoy. 
Hope some of the jokes will get you!
Enjoy
